\section{Introduction}
The RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm[1, 11] is a powerful technique for estimating the parameters of a model with the data that may be contaminated by outliers. Introduced in 1981, it is still widely used to solve various problem. Especially in computer vision: epipolar geometry estimation, multi-view geometry, object retrieval, motion estimation, structure from motion and features-based localization.
Recently, deep learning has shown great success in several areas, as well as in computer vision: image classification, object detection, and ... [...]
However the Deep Learning is still not able to compete with traditional algorithm, like RANSAC, in geometry related areas[2]. CNN to image like Posenet
In this paper, we replace the RANSAC with machine learning algorithm, which should be able to fit complicated models while recognize the outliers in the input data. In the case of relative pose estimation we don’t have to worry about the camera matrix and image distortion. And the inputs of RANSAC is limited to the location of the match point in the images. We can add additional information to the input feature to further improve the performance. 

\section{Architectural Details (Network Design)}
The most important part of the new neural network (XXNet) is able to handle the input feature list with variable size with no particular order. Recurrent neural network (RNN) is contain cyclic connections that make them a more powerful tool to model sequence data than feed-forward neural networks.

Architect
The XXnet has two steps: First a small set of input features, randomly selected and randomlyordered, is sent to the same subnetwork. Second the outputs of subnetwork are aggregated to get the final result. (Figure \ref{xxNet}).
